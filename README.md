# Complex Calculator
i made a cute little calculator that computes complex numbers typed from the keyboard 
the inpus has to be something like :

c1 OP c1 OP c2 OP c4 

where c1,c2,c3,c4 are complex numbers 

and OP is one of the 4 operations : + - * / 

there can be as many numbers and operations as you wish
also the complex number can look like : 

c1=a+-ib     |
c2=a-i    |
c3=+-i    |
c4=a    |
c5=a+-i*b    |
c6=b*i   etc.

where a, b are real numbers(aka double in java terms)

If you have any tips on how to improve the code let me know !!! (i tried my best and i know this is not the most efficient way)
